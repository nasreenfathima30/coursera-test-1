          <h2>Chicken</h2>
              Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

              <h2>Beef</h2>
              Beef has been a staple meat eaten around the world for millennia, dating back as far as prehistory. Cattle originated in the Old World, having been domesticated around 8000 BC when the material gains from the livestock became apparent.The French referred to cow as boeuf, which then got morphed to today's beef. The French words stuck and that is how we got the word beef and not cow, which makes sense, seeing as how French words tend to litter the English language.The beef was first eaten 8000 BC, We've been eating beef since prehistoric times, as evidenced by the earliest cave paintings depiction of the hunt for the aurochs, a primitive bovine. Domestication of cattle happened around 8000 BC, and that is when beef consumption really took off.

              <h2>Sushi</h2>
              Sushi traces its origins back for millennia.This dish consisted of fermented rice and salted fish. And, despite what you may think, it wasn’t fermented and salted for flavor. The dish’s earliest known origin was in the 2nd century BC – so it predates refrigerators by nearly 2,000 years.Because of this, narezushi was actually a very practical dish. The rice was fermented to preserve it, and the fish was also salted heavily to prevent the growth of bacteria and microorganisms – keeping it fresh longer, even when stored without any kind of refrigeration. And, interestingly, the rice was typically thrown out when eating the fish. It was used only to wrap and preserve the fish.The first reference to “sushi” appeared in the Yoro Code, written in the year 718.Over the following centuries, the dish slowly began to change.However, this sushi was not quite the same as the sushi we know today. It was often cooked – due to a lack of refrigeration – and served in larger pieces.Instead of just throwing out the rice, it could be tossed with a bit of vinegar, and a small sliver of fish could be placed on top, making a flavorful, bite-sized treat that was delicious, portable, and affordable for the masses.
